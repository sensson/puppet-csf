[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sensson/puppet-csf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sensson/puppet-csf) [![Puppet Forge](https://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/sensson/csf.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://forge.puppet.com/sensson/csf)

This module manages ConfigServer Firewall and the Login Failure Daemon.

By default it will open up port 8140 for outgoing connections to the puppet
master. All other ports are unmanaged and set to the default that comes
with the installation of CSF. You definitely want to change this.

## Examples

### Installation and configuration

This will install CSF and only allow access through port 22.

```
class { 'csf': }
csf::config { 'TCP_IN': value => '22' }
```

#### Open up a port in CSF

The most basic functionality is to open up a port in CSF. You can open
up an incoming port with the following basic example:

```
csf::ipv4::input { '443': }
```

A little more advanced is the following example where we specifically
tell CSF it should open a TCP port.

```
csf::ipv4::input  { '3306':
  proto => 'tcp',
}
```

Of course, you can use arrays too to open up more ports at the same time

```
csf::ipv4::input { [ '80', '443' ]: }
```

As soon as you remove a port it will not be part of the configuration
any more.

#### Making global changes: allow, deny and ignore

CSF has some default configurations you can use to either ignore, deny or allow
IP addresses from either accessing your server or to prevent they will
get banned by the Login Failure Daemon.

To allow an IP address, or range, you can use the following code

```
csf::allow { '192.168.0.0/24': }
```

In contrast with ports, you will have to specifically disable a setting to
remove it from the config, for example:

```
csf::allow { '192.168.0.0/24': ensure => absent, }
```

Similar functions are available for csf::ignore and csf::deny. All of these
functions accept arrays too.

#### Add advanced rules to CSF

This module allows you to set up advanced iptables rules if you need to.

For example:

```
csf::rule { 'csf-rule-port-80-from-192.168.0.1':
  content => "/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.0.1/32 -j ACCEPT",
  order => "1",
}
```

This will set up a rule that allows traffic to port 80 only from the internal
ip address 192.168.0.1/32. You can order firewall rules if needed. It will by
default add rules to /etc/csf/csfpost.sh, but you can specify csfpre too by using
`target => '/etc/csf/csfpre.sh` if you need to run rules before other parts are
initialized.

Removing a csf::rule from your configuration will automatically remove it from
the running config as well.

## Hiera

We support hiera.

```
csf::ipv4::input::ports:
  '82':
    proto: udp
  '81': {}
```

Will open up port 82 UDP and 81 TCP. Similar Hiera settings are available for
`csf::ipv4::output::ports`, `csf::allow::hosts`, `csf::ignore::hosts`,
`csf::deny::hosts` and `csf::config::settings`. Setting {} is required when
you're not specifying any other parameters. All settings from the parent are
supported.

## Reference

### Parameters

#### csf

##### `download_location`

This allows you to override the download location. Defaults to https://download.configserver.com/csf.tgz

##### `service_ensure`

This allows you to set the ensure flag on the CSF service. Defaults to 'running'.

##### `service_enable`

This allows you to set the enable flag on the CSF service. Defaults to 'true'.

##### `docker`

This allows you to enable or disable support for Docker. Defaults to 'absent'.

### Defines

#### csf::config

You can change settings in /etc/csf/csf.conf with `csf::config`. Keep in mind that it is case sensitive.

Alternatively you can manage ports using `csf::ipv4::input`. `csf::config` is mainly aimed
at changing configuration settings such as DENY_IP_LIMIT and so on.

##### `ensure`

Specify if you want the config setting to exist or not. This is particularly useful
if you made a mistake. Defaults to 'present'.

actually exists. If you make a mistake here it will simply add it. Defaults to ''.

##### `value`

Set the value of the configuration setting you want to change. Defaults to ''.

## Development

We strongly believe in the power of open source. This module is our way
of saying thanks.

This module is tested against the Ruby versions from Puppet's support
matrix. Please make sure you have a supported version of Ruby installed.

If you want to contribute please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Run tests. It's always good to know that you can start with a clean slate.
3. Add a test for your change.
4. Make sure it passes.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

We can only accept pull requests with passing tests.

To install all of its dependencies please run:

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle --without development
```

### Running unit tests

```
bundle exec rake test
```

### Running acceptance tests

The unit tests only verify if the code runs, not if it does exactly
what we want on a real machine. For this we use Beaker. Beaker will
start a new virtual machine (using Vagrant) and runs a series of
simple tests.

You can run Beaker tests with:

```
bundle exec rake spec_prep
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:debian8
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:debian9
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:debian10
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:centos6
BEAKER_destroy=onpass BEAKER_PUPPET_COLLECTION=puppet5 bundle exec rake beaker:centos7
BEAKER_destroy=onpass BEAKER_PUPPET_COLLECTION=puppet5 bundle exec rake beaker:centos8
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:ubuntu1404
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:ubuntu1604
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:ubuntu1804
BEAKER_destroy=onpass bundle exec rake beaker:ubuntu2004
```

We recommend specifying BEAKER_destroy=onpass as it will keep the
Vagrant machine running in case something fails.
